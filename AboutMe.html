      Zimbabwe, Harare</a>. And i have been in the states since i was 10 years old. <br>
    I am married and my wife is pregnant. Our expected due date is November 18. We are expecting a boy. <br>
    This will be my first child. I am looking forward to the whole experience. I have told my wife that our baby will
    grow up watching <br>

    I am drawn to the world of software development. I have have some experience with programming. I have some knowledge
    of programming languages <br>
    we will be using in this class. I am looking forward to learning more and building on the foundations that we learn.
    <br>
    I have always loved solving problems. When i see something that is going to be difficult my first reaction is always
    <q>This will be fun.</q> When <br>
    my wife first heard this she thought i was be sarcastic, but i explained to her that finding ways to solve problems
    is something I enjoying doing. <br>
    The career path of software development just seems to make sense to me. A career path requires consistent learning
    and always learning about new <br>
    ways to solve problems is an exciting experience for me. <br>
    I am looking forward to learning about
